### Governance Types

#### BDFL

This repository works through the BDFL â€“ Benevolent Dictator For Life - model. That means that a single maintainer, `@USERNAME`, holds all of the admin keys and write access for this repository. Other users are encouraged to open issues, submit Pull Requests, and to ask for recognition as maintainers, but all decisions ultimately lie with the core maintainer. 

This maintainer is open to/not open to others joining on the admin team for this repository. 

#### Abandon-ware

This repository is abandoned. The core maintainer has expressed no more desire for maintaining it. However, they are open to others who have shown their expertise taking over the process. 

#### Single core committee

This repository is run by a single core committee, who all have write-access and a say in technical and governance decisions. Members of the committee include `@USER1, @USER2, @USER3`. Other users are encouraged to open issues, submit Pull Requests, and to ask for recognition as maintainers, but all decisions ultimately lie with the core maintaining group. 

This maintainer is open to/not open to others joining on the admin team for this repository.
